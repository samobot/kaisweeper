# KaiSweeper
A port of Minesweeper for KaiOS devices.&nbsp; KaiOS is a mobile operating system whose apps are essentially locally-installed webapps.

### Notes
The input scripts need to be modified slightly (alternate key names) to work on a physical KaiOS phone.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I don't have a device to test on, so I have to use the simulator which only takes keyboard inputs.\
\
Keyboard controls are: WASD to move cursor, F to flag a bomb, Space to sweep a tile.\
\
The app is not on the KaiStore and thus needs to be sideloaded.&nbsp;  As such, that limits it to KaiOS 2.X devices since no current 3.X devices have the ability to sideload apps.
